# Enterprise UI Studio

A browser IDE for building pages with `@enterprise-ui/react`: drag components onto a live canvas,
edit properties in an inspector driven by the generated API metadata, and edit every line in a
Monaco code editor with the library's TypeScript types. Design: [`docs/plans/ide-design.md`](../docs/plans/ide-design.md).

- `npm run dev:studio` starts it on <http://localhost:5174>.
- `npm run build:docs` builds the docs and the Studio; the Studio is published at `docs-dist/studio/`
  and linked from the docs navigation and from every example ("Open in Studio").

The Studio and projects exported from it are MIT licensed (see `LICENSE` and `template/LICENSE`).
The library's own license is not changed by this folder.

## Saved projects and upgrading from M2

Projects are saved in the browser's IndexedDB database `eui-studio`, version 2, which has two stores: `projects` and `meta`.
The first time an M3 build opens a browser that has M2 data, it copies the single M2 page
(the `current` record in the `projects` store) into a project named "My application". The original `current`
record is kept unchanged and is never read again.

**Downgrading to an M2 build is not supported.** M2 opens the database as version 1, so on a v2 database
opening it fails (`VersionError`): the Studio shows its default page and cannot save. To recover the M2 page by hand:

1. Open DevTools → Application (Chrome/Edge) or Storage (Firefox) → IndexedDB → `eui-studio` → `projects`.
2. Select the `current` entry and copy its `code` value, which holds the page source as it was at the upgrade.
   Newer work is in the project records (look for `files["src/App.tsx"]`).
3. Paste the code into the M2 Studio, or into `src/App.tsx` of an exported project.

Deleting the `eui-studio` database removes all saved projects, including the `current` record.
