# Enterprise UI Studio

A browser IDE for building pages with `@enterprise-ui/react`: drag components onto a live canvas,
edit properties in an inspector driven by the generated API metadata, and edit every line in a
Monaco code editor with the library's TypeScript types. Design: [`docs/plans/ide-design.md`](../docs/plans/ide-design.md).

- `npm run dev:studio` starts it on <http://localhost:5174>.
- `npm run build:docs` builds the docs and the Studio; the Studio is published at `docs-dist/studio/`
  and linked from the docs navigation and from every example ("Open in Studio").

The Studio and projects exported from it are MIT licensed (see `LICENSE` and `template/LICENSE`).
The library's own license is not changed by this folder.

## Features (milestones M0–M2)

- **M0, app and delivery:** a separate Vite app (`studio/vite.config.ts`) that shares the sandboxed
  preview build with the docs (`scripts/sandbox-bundle.ts`).
- **M1, code-first editing:** a lazy-loaded Monaco editor with the library's TypeScript declarations
  (autocomplete, diagnostics, folding, find), Prettier formatting, and a live sandboxed preview in
  all 7 themes.
- **M2, visual editing:** a Babel-parsed page model in which edits are text splices, so formatting and
  comments are preserved. A palette generated from the API metadata (drag onto the canvas, or press
  Enter to insert at the selection), an outline tree, canvas selection with drop indicators, an
  Inspector with Properties, Events and States tabs, move up/down, duplicate and delete actions, and
  one undo/redo history for visual and code edits.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Keys | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Ctrl/Cmd+S | Save the project |
| Shift+Alt+F | Format the code with Prettier |
| Ctrl/Cmd+Z | Undo |
| Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Z or Ctrl/Cmd+Y | Redo |
| Alt+Up / Alt+Down | Move the selected element |
| Delete or Backspace (in the outline) | Delete the selected element |
| Enter (in the palette) | Insert the component at the selection |

Inside the code editor, and in form fields, undo and redo are handled by the editor or field itself,
and the move and delete shortcuts don't apply.

## Saving and export

- The project is autosaved in the browser's IndexedDB.
- **Download App.tsx** downloads the page as a single `App.tsx` file. There is no multi-file or ZIP
  export yet.

## Known limits

- Single page only. Multi-file projects, templates and ZIP export/import are planned for M3; test
  runner and accessibility panels for M4.
- The Inspector covers only documented props, so inherited HTML events such as Button `onClick`
  don't appear in the Events tab.
- Elements inside expressions such as `{items.map(...)}` are locked and must be edited in code.

## Tests and size budget

- Unit: `tests/studio/jsx-model.test.ts` (parsing, edits, moves, imports, history, widget inference,
  catalog).
- End-to-end: `tests/e2e/studio.spec.ts`.
- Size: `npm run test:studio-size` (after `npm run build:docs`) fails if the initial download goes
  over 350 kB gzip, or if Monaco, the TypeScript worker or Prettier end up in it. Measured at
  `64fcbd0`: 237.1 kB gzip.
